# System Model of the proposed DL-BHA
The system model consists of several functional components, including the smart city environment with embedded IoT devices for various smart city applications. The temporally collected data from these devices is stored in a data storage unit and subsequently utilized by the developed DL-BHA model. The LSTM, used as the deep learning component, analyzes the data patterns and provides energy consumption predictions and anomaly detection to the BHA. The BHA then assists decision-makers and smart city planners in making optimized decisions based on the outputs of the developed model. The underlying mechanism of the LSTM for anomaly detection and energy efficiency is presented in Figure 2.

# Results
The results are evaluated through energy efficiency using loss function and R2 and anomaly detection performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure.
## Energy Efficiency 
First, the underfitting and overfitting of the developed hybrid DL-BHA model are assessed using the loss function and RÂ²-score. Then, a heterogeneity test is performed by incorporating different noise levels (30%, 50%, and 100%), as described in Figures 5 and 6. Subsequently, energy efficiency is evaluated at these different heterogeneity levels, as illustrated in Figure 7. A sensitivity analysis is then conducted using the Bland-Altman plot, as presented in Figure 8. Based on the findings, the energy efficiency trend is evaluated and presented in Figure 9.
