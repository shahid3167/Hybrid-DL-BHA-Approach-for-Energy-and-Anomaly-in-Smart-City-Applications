# System Model of the proposed DL-BHA
The system model consists of several functional components, including the smart city environment with embedded IoT devices for various smart city applications. The temporally collected data from these devices is stored in a data storage unit and subsequently utilized by the developed DL-BHA model. The LSTM, used as the deep learning component, analyzes the data patterns and provides energy consumption predictions and anomaly detection to the BHA. The BHA then assists decision-makers and smart city planners in making optimized decisions based on the outputs of the developed model.
